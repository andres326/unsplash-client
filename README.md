# Unsplash Front

Unsplash is a project made with ReactJS.

## Description

Unsplash is an app that allows uploading images by URL, search images by name, and deleting images. Was made with ReactJs using create-react-app in the frontend, using Bootstrap for styling, and ExpressJS for the backend.

## Installation 
You'll need NodeJs to be installed on your machine. Also, you need to clone the [backend repository](https://github.com/andres326/unsplash-api) in order to get all things working. Clone the repository and install the dependencies using: 

```bash
npm install
```

After the installation, you'll need to create a .env file with the following variable __REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT__ which should contain the URL with the backend. After that, you can start running:

```bash
npm start
```
